       <p> I'm not sure if it's me or if anyone else ever experiences that
       initial awkwardness when writing about yourself. You stop and think, "I
       need to convince these people that I’m awesome because I am. Well, don’t
       get too confident. But also don’t mistake humility with tearing yourself
       down." And that is how I landed here for my introduction. When thinking
       about coding, I realize it is a very human thing. It's algorithms and one
       zeros and markup and markdown sure. But what we build is to be used by
       people. So we must be okay with being human, with admitting there is more
       to learn and others to learn from. I myself am a graduate of a liberal
       arts college, <a href="http://arbor.edu" target="_blank">Spring Arbor University </a> to be exact. There, after 5 years
       (needed a "victory" lap), I received my degree in English. I also
       received and took to heart part of our alma mater, to be a lifelong
       learner. That is how ended up in a coding bootcamp <a
       href="http://wecanecodeit.org" target="_blank">(We Can Code It)</a> learning full stack
       development in ASP.NET. I have some snapshots and the links for the code
       in my <a href="Projects.html" target="_blank">projects.</a> Feel free to go and check them out. Also check out my
       blog about my journey through game development and coding and general
       ways life influences my coding and vice-versa. </p> </div>
