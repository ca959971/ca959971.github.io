Here starts the beginning of the something I always wanted to try: building my own video game. I think this is something that most guys have always wanted to do or at least dream about doing at some point in life. I think it's amazing that all the tools needed are literally within our grasp, just a few google searches away.
More so, it fields good to create, to build. I like buying and playing video games, listening to music, binging YouTube, etc. But I always have the thought in the back of my head, "what if you could make some stuff too?" And that's really what I want to do. I'm not looking to be filthy rich or anything like that. I just want to do something that I enjoy, even if it's only in my spare time. Thanks to everyone who's gonna join me on this adventure!
