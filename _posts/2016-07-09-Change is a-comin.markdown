I started this blog with intention of using it a way to stay accountable for development projects. But it is only a few weeks later that I have now started a second post. Regardless, it is good to at least be in the process of of restarting something, of doing. The thing that anyone needs to do is start and not worry about the beginning because no one is going to be an expert in the beginning. So you have to push through the beginning  because that beginning is difficult.
